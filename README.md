# 📊 Healthcare Analysis Project

This project analyzes hospital admission trends and revenue fluctuations during the period of late 2023 through 2024. Using data exploration and visualization, we investigate a significant 65% decline in patient numbers and income across all hospital branches.

## 🔍 Objective

To uncover patterns in admission types, patient demographics, and common diagnoses that may explain the drop in hospital admissions and revenue — with the ultimate goal of providing actionable recommendations for healthcare providers.

## 📁 Project Components

- **Healthcare.ipynb** – Data analysis and visualizations in Python.
- **Healthcare_Analysis_Report.pdf** – Formal report summarizing findings, insights, and recommendations.
- **visualization.pbix** – Power BI dashboard for interactive data exploration.

## 📈 Key Insights

- Elective procedures were the most affected, heavily contributing to the revenue drop.
- Elderly males are the dominant demographic group; diabetes and arthritis are the most frequent diagnoses.
- Children admissions remain stable, primarily via emergency visits (asthma-related).
- Across all hospitals, system-wide factors (not local) likely contributed to the drop.

## 📌 Recommendations

- Conduct surveys to understand care delays.
- Improve hospital scheduling and community engagement.
- Partner with insurers to make elective care more accessible.
- Monitor patient satisfaction and feedback in real time.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Power BI
- Microsoft Word (reporting)
